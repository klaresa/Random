#**DRAW IT**

### **This is just a small squared (18x18)  pixel canvas made with pure JS.**

This was intended to be a **```addEventListener```** fest so i could understand some of its uses in a code. As to manipulate the DOM we gotta do some queries I also use **```querySelector```** and **```querySelectorAll```**.

The HTML file was also intended to be injected by JS. Im aware of the time it takes to do so.

Also, working with **```classList```** can be pretty fun as I enjoy seeing those pink modifications to the html elements. 

If you do want to help me out with tips im all up for it! <3

*Feel free to mod it as you wish ofc* :)
