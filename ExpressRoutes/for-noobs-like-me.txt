to run this:

 - on its directory run: node src/index.js ;
	Note: everytime you change index.js you must restart node unless you use tools like nodemon.

 - on your browser enter: http://localhost:3333/plants or http://localhost:3333/plants/1 ;
	Note: you can only excecute GET methods on your browser. To test other methods you'll need a way to send requests: try a REST client like postman or insomnia (my choice).

 - on your test choice :

	POST localhost:3333/plants
		{
		"id": "2", (or whichever id)
		"details": [] 
		}

	POST localhost:3333/plants/2 (or whichever id)
		{
		"plant": "a new plant"	
		}

	POST localhost:3333/plants/1/details
		{
		"plant": "Cante", 
		"quantity": "1"
		}

	PUT localhost:3333/plants/2 (or whichever id)
		{
		"plant": "edit that plant name"
		}

	DELETE localhost:3333/plants/2
